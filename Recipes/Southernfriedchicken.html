    <img class="picha"  src="./Southern Fried Chicken.jpg" alt="">
    <p> <em> A flavorful crispy</em> breading on the outside with a tender and moist center is what Southern Fried Chicken is all about. It's the sort of finger-licking-good comfort food that appeals to everyone. Serve it with your favorite homestyle sides and wash it all down with a glass of sweet tea for a taste of the South in your mouth.</p>
